# 🐍 Mastering Python Essentials – Scaler Certification

Welcome to my Python journey! This repository contains everything I studied and practiced while completing the **Scaler Python Essentials Certification**. It is divided into two main parts:

- 📘 **Detailed Notes**  
- 🧠 **120 Practice Questions** (from Basics to OOP)

---

## 📁 Contents

- `Scalar_Python_Course.ipynb` – Well-organized notes covering Python from scratch  
- `Python_Practice_120.ipynb` – A set of solved questions with explanations, structured topic-wise

## 🧩 Topics Covered

Below is a breakdown of all topics included in both the notes and practice sections:

---

### 🔹 1. Python Basics
- Print statements, comments
- Variables and dynamic typing
- Data types: int, float, string, bool
- Type casting

---

### 🔹 2. Control Flow
- Conditional statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Nested conditions
- Logical operators

---

### 🔹 3. Loops
- `for` loops and `while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, and `pass`
- Nested loops and pattern questions

---

### 🔹 4. Strings
- Indexing and slicing
- String methods: `.lower()`, `.upper()`, `.replace()`, etc.
- String formatting (f-strings)

---

### 🔹 5. Lists & Tuples
- List methods: `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`, etc.
- Tuples and immutability
- Looping through lists/tuples

---

### 🔹 6. Sets & Dictionaries
- Set operations: union, intersection, difference
- Dictionary basics
- Accessing, updating, and looping through dictionaries

---

### 🔹 7. Functions
- `def` keyword, parameters, return values
- Default arguments
- `*args` and `**kwargs`
- Scope: local vs global
- Lambda functions

---

### 🔹 8. File Handling
- Opening/closing files
- Modes: `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`
- `.read()`, `.readline()`, `.write()`, `.seek()`, `.tell()`

---

### 🔹 9. Exception Handling
- `try-except` blocks
- `finally` and `else`
- Common errors: `ZeroDivisionError`, `ValueError`, etc.
- Custom error messages

---

### 🔹 10. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- `__init__()` constructor
- Instance vs class variables
- Inheritance and `super()`
- Method overriding

---

## 🧠 Practice Philosophy

For each topic, I wrote 8–15 practice questions to reinforce concepts. These range from simple syntax checks to small challenges like:
- Palindrome checker (Strings)
- Prime number & pattern generators (Loops)
- ATM mini simulator (Functions)
- Banking system (OOP)
